The first set of test cases is to construct the sequential blocks as intended in ConStabL

### Testing init event with sequential statements inside entry blocks
test1.stbl - Only statechart SC 
test2.stbl - Statechart SC with atomic default substate 
test3.stbl - Statechart SC with composite default substate
test4.stbl - Statechart SC with shell default substate
test5.stbl - Statechart SC with nested shell default substate

### Testing Exit from atomic states of SC - through event e1 - guard true
test6.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - atomic to atomic - X;A;N - pass
test7.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - atomic to composite- X;A;N - pass
test8.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - atomic to shell- X;A;N - pass
test9.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - atomic to shell within shell- X;A;N - yet to test

### Testing Exit from composite states of SC- through event e1 - guard true
test10.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - composite to atomic - X;A;N - pass
test11.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - composite to composite- X;A;N - pass
test12.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - composite to shell- X;A;N - pass
test13.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - composite to shell within shell- X;A;N - yet to test

### Testing Exit from atomic default substate of composite states of SC- through event e1 - guard true
test14.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - inner state of composite to atomic - X;A;N - pass
test15.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - inner state of composite to composite- X;A;N - pass
test16.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - inner state of composite to shell- X;A;N - pass
test17.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - inner state of composite to shell within shell- X;A;N - yet to test


========
test7.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - composite
test8.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - shell
test9.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of composite
test10.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of shell (region)
test11.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of region (composite)
test12.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of region (atomic)
test13.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of region (shell)
test14.stbl - exit from substate of statechart SC - substate of region (substate of shell)
